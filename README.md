### Using FakeStoreAPI

[FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com) is a free online REST API that you can use whenever you need Pseudo-real data for
your e-commerce or shopping website without running any server-side code.
It's awesome for teaching purposes, sample codes, tests and etc.

You can visit in detail docs in [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com) for more information.

## Why?

As part of an assignment I had to design a PRODUCT LISTING PAGE and needed fake data.


## Resource
- Products https://fakestoreapi.com/products


## How to
you can fetch data with any kind of methods you know(fetch API, Axios, jquery ajax,...)

### Get all products

```js
fetch("https://fakestoreapi.com/products")
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((json) => console.log(json));
```
